# MoonLove-Faststart
Some templates and basic engine structure using Lua, Love and Moonscript. Intended to be used specially in game jams such as Ludum Dare and for rapid game prototyping.

## Sublime Build Instalation
Grab "Compile Moon and Run Love.sublime-build" and paste it Sublime build systems folder (```%AppData%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\``` if you are wondering where it is). This will allow you to compile and run your game very fast.

## Here's how the folders are supposed to work:
* **bin:** This is where the .exe or similar will be placed when you pack your game for distribution.
* **lua:** Lua files that LÃ¶ve will use.
* **src:** Moon files that will be compiled into Lua files by sublime.

## Usage
First add the root folder to Sublime (Project > Add Folder to Project). Then you can just make your game in the ```src/``` folder, placing your .moon files in there. Select the build Compile Moon and Run Love build system (Tools > Build System > Compile Moon and Run Love) and press Control + B to run your game.

## To Do
There is still a **lot** of things to improve here, here's the main ones for now:
* Make a better engine framework
* Scripts for packing your Love File
* General utilities
* Placeholder assets
